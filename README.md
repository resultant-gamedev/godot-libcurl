![Godot libcurl module label](/label.png)

Libcurl is a popular solution for HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP and countless other protocols licensed under MIT/X license. Please note that currently it's work in progress so basically nothing works :D 

Because module specific documentation isn't really a thing in godot, please use API index https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/allfuncs.html to get what it's all about. 

# Installation

You'll most likely need `libcurl-dev` package to get this thing up and compiling. Just run the following command to get all of the libcurl action

`sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libcurl4-nss-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev`

You can find more information about libcurl at https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl.html
